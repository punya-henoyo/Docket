# insecure deserialization — for triage over source

You are judging whether a reported finding is REACHABLE by
untrusted input, by reading source. You execute nothing.

The "Not a bug when" list below is the important half. Your job is as much ruling
things out as confirming them: a finding you can show is unreachable saves someone a
day, and a wrong `exploitable` verdict costs the same person a day. When the source
does not settle it, return `uncertain` — that is a real answer, not a failure.

## Not a bug when

- Base64 data is encrypted or signed with verified HMAC before deserialization
- Only primitive types deserialized (whitelist schema, no polymorphic types)
- `pickle`/`Marshal` not used; JSON parsed to dict without object instantiation
- Deserialization in isolated sandbox with no network/exec primitives (verify thoroughly)
- Error mentions serialization class but input is never passed to unmarshal (dead code path)

## Impact if it IS real

- Remote code execution on application servers
- Authentication bypass via forged session objects
- Privilege escalation through manipulated role/admin fields in deserialized classes
- Full application compromise in Java/PHP/.NET stacks with known gadget libraries

Adapted from the strix project's `skills/vulnerabilities/insecure_deserialization.md` (Apache-2.0). Changes: sections
covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's triage agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
