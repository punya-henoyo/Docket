# path traversal lfi rfi — for triage over source

You are judging whether a reported finding is REACHABLE by
untrusted input, by reading source. You execute nothing.

The "Not a bug when" list below is the important half. Your job is as much ruling
things out as confirming them: a finding you can show is unreachable saves someone a
day, and a wrong `exploitable` verdict costs the same person a day. When the source
does not settle it, return `uncertain` — that is a real answer, not a failure.

## Not a bug when

- In-app virtual paths that do not map to filesystem; content comes from safe stores (DB/object storage)
- Canonicalized paths constrained to an allowlist/root after normalization
- Wrappers disabled and includes using constant templates only
- Archive extractors that sanitize paths and enforce destination directories

## Impact if it IS real

- Sensitive configuration/source disclosure → credential and key compromise
- Code execution via inclusion of attacker-controlled content or overwritten templates
- Persistence via dropped files in served directories; lateral movement via revealed secrets
- Supply-chain impact when report/template engines execute attacker-influenced files

Adapted from the strix project's `skills/vulnerabilities/path_traversal_lfi_rfi.md` (Apache-2.0). Changes: sections
covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's triage agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
