# broken function level authorization — for triage over source

You are judging whether a reported finding is REACHABLE by
untrusted input, by reading source. You execute nothing.

The "Not a bug when" list below is the important half. Your job is as much ruling
things out as confirming them: a finding you can show is unreachable saves someone a
day, and a wrong `exploitable` verdict costs the same person a day. When the source
does not settle it, return `uncertain` — that is a real answer, not a failure.

## Not a bug when

- Read-only endpoints mislabeled as admin but publicly documented
- Feature toggles intentionally open to all roles for preview/beta with clear policy
- Simulated environments where admin endpoints are stubbed with no side effects

## Impact if it IS real

- Privilege escalation to admin/staff actions
- Monetary/state impact: refunds/credits/approvals without authorization
- Tenant-wide configuration changes, impersonation, or data deletion
- Compliance and audit violations due to bypassed approval workflows

Adapted from the strix project's `skills/vulnerabilities/broken_function_level_authorization.md` (Apache-2.0). Changes: sections
covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's triage agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
