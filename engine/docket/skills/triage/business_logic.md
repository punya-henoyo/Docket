# business logic — for triage over source

You are judging whether a reported finding is REACHABLE by
untrusted input, by reading source. You execute nothing.

The "Not a bug when" list below is the important half. Your job is as much ruling
things out as confirming them: a finding you can show is unreachable saves someone a
day, and a wrong `exploitable` verdict costs the same person a day. When the source
does not settle it, return `uncertain` — that is a real answer, not a failure.

## Not a bug when

- Promotional behavior explicitly allowed by policy (documented free trials, goodwill credits)
- Visual-only inconsistencies with no durable or exploitable state change
- Admin-only operations with proper audit and approvals

## Impact if it IS real

- Direct financial loss (fraud, arbitrage, over-refunds, unpaid consumption)
- Regulatory/contractual violations (billing accuracy, consumer protection)
- Denial of inventory/services to legitimate users through resource exhaustion
- Privilege retention or unauthorized access to premium features

Adapted from the strix project's `skills/vulnerabilities/business_logic.md` (Apache-2.0). Changes: sections
covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's triage agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
