# business logic — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

- Financial logic: pricing, discounts, payments, refunds, credits, chargebacks
- Account lifecycle: signup, upgrade/downgrade, trial, suspension, deletion
- Authorization-by-logic: feature gates, role transitions, approval workflows
- Quotas/limits: rate/usage limits, inventory, entitlements, seat licensing
- Multi-tenant isolation: cross-organization data or action bleed
- Event-driven flows: jobs, webhooks, sagas, compensations, idempotency

## Shapes this takes in code

### State Machine Abuse

- Skip or reorder steps via direct API calls; verify server enforces preconditions on each transition
- Replay prior steps with altered parameters (e.g., swap price after approval but before capture)
- Split a single constrained action into many sub-actions under the threshold (limit slicing)

### Concurrency and Idempotency

- Parallelize identical operations to bypass atomic checks (create, apply, redeem, transfer)
- Abuse idempotency: key scoped to path but not principal → reuse other users' keys; or idempotency stored only in cache
- Message reprocessing: queue workers re-run tasks on retry without idempotent guards; cause duplicate fulfillment/refund

### Numeric and Currency

- Floating point vs decimal rounding; rounding/truncation favoring attacker at boundaries
- Cross-currency arbitrage: buy in currency A, refund in B at stale rates; tax rounding per-item vs per-order
- Negative amounts, zero-price, free shipping thresholds, minimum/maximum guardrails

### Quotas, Limits, and Inventory

- Off-by-one and time-bound resets (UTC vs local); pre-warm at T-1s and post-fire at T+1s
- Reservation/hold leaks: reserve multiple, complete one, release not enforced; backorder logic inconsistencies
- Distributed counters without strong consistency enabling double-consumption

### Refunds and Chargebacks

- Double-refund: refund via UI and support tool; refund partials summing above captured amount
- Refund after benefits consumed (downloaded digital goods, shipped items) due to missing post-consumption checks

### Feature Gates and Roles

- Feature flags enforced client-side or at edge but not in core services; toggle names guessed or fallback to default-enabled
- Role transitions leaving stale capabilities (retain premium after downgrade; retain admin endpoints after demotion)

## Where to look first

- Pricing/cart: price locks, quote to order, tax/shipping computation
- Discount engines: stacking, mutual exclusivity, scope (cart vs item), once-per-user enforcement
- Payments: auth/capture/void/refund sequences, partials, split tenders, chargebacks, idempotency keys
- Credits/gift cards/vouchers: issuance, redemption, reversal, expiry, transferability
- Subscriptions: proration, upgrade/downgrade, trial extension, seat counts, meter reporting
- Refunds/returns/RMAs: multi-item partials, restocking fees, return window edges
- Admin/staff operations: impersonation, manual adjustments, credit/refund issuance, account flags
- Quotas/limits: daily/monthly usage, inventory reservations, feature usage counters

## Special Contexts

### E-commerce

- Stack incompatible discounts via parallel apply; remove qualifying item after discount applied; retain free shipping after cart changes
- Modify shipping tier post-quote; abuse returns to keep product and refund

### Banking/Fintech

- Split transfers to bypass per-transaction threshold; schedule vs instant path inconsistencies
- Exploit grace periods on holds/authorizations to withdraw again before settlement

### SaaS/B2B

- Seat licensing: race seat assignment to exceed purchased seats; stale license checks in background tasks
- Usage metering: report late or duplicate usage to avoid billing or to over-consume

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
