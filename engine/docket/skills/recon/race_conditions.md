# race conditions — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Read-Modify-Write**
- Sequences without atomicity or proper locking

**Multi-Step Operations**
- Check → reserve → commit with gaps between phases

**Cross-Service Workflows**
- Sagas, async jobs with eventual consistency

**Rate Limits and Quotas**
- Controls implemented at the edge only

## Shapes this takes in code

### Request Synchronization

- HTTP/2 multiplexing for tight concurrency; send many requests on warmed connections
- Last-byte synchronization: hold requests open and release final byte simultaneously
- Connection warming: pre-establish sessions, cookies, and TLS to remove jitter

### Idempotency and Dedup Bypass

- Reuse the same idempotency key across different principals/paths if scope is inadequate
- Hit the endpoint before the idempotency store is written (cache-before-commit windows)
- App-level dedup drops only the response while side effects (emails/credits) still occur

### Atomicity Gaps

- Lost update: read-modify-write increments without atomic DB statements
- Partial two-phase workflows: success committed before validation completes
- Unique checks done outside a unique index/upsert: create duplicates under load

### Cross-Service Races

- Saga/compensation timing gaps: execute compensation without preventing the original success path
- Eventual consistency windows: act in Service B before Service A's write is visible
- Retry storms: duplicate side effects due to at-least-once delivery without idempotent consumers

### Rate Limits and Quotas

- Per-IP or per-connection enforcement: bypass with multiple IPs/sessions
- Counter updates not atomic or sharded inconsistently; send bursts before counters propagate

### Optimistic Concurrency Evasion

- Omit If-Match/ETag where optional; supply stale versions if server ignores them
- Version fields accepted but not validated across all code paths (e.g., GraphQL vs REST)

### Database Isolation

- Exploit READ COMMITTED/REPEATABLE READ anomalies: phantoms, non-serializable sequences
- Upsert races: use unique indexes with proper ON CONFLICT/UPSERT or exploit naive existence checks
- Lock granularity issues: row vs table; application locks held only in-process

### Distributed Locks

- Redis locks without NX/EX or fencing tokens allow multiple winners
- Locks stored in memory on a single node; bypass by hitting other nodes/regions

## Where to look first

- Payments: auth/capture/refund/void; credits/loyalty points; gift cards
- Coupons/discounts: single-use codes, stacking checks, per-user limits
- Quotas/limits: API usage, inventory reservations, seat counts, vote limits
- Auth flows: password reset/OTP consumption, session minting, device trust
- File/object storage: multi-part finalize, version writes, share-link generation
- Background jobs: export/import create/finalize endpoints; job cancellation/approve
- GraphQL mutations and batch operations; WebSocket actions

## Special Contexts

### GraphQL

- Parallel mutations and batched operations may bypass per-mutation guards
- Ensure resolver-level idempotency and atomicity
- Persisted queries and aliases can hide multiple state changes in one request

### WebSocket

- Per-message authorization and idempotency must hold
- Concurrent emits can create duplicates if only the handshake is checked

### Files and Storage

- Parallel finalize/complete on multi-part uploads can create duplicate or corrupted objects
- Re-use pre-signed URLs concurrently

### Auth Flows

- Concurrent consumption of one-time tokens (reset codes, magic links) to mint multiple sessions
- Verify consume is atomic

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's recon agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
