# xxe — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Capabilities**
- File disclosure: read server files and configuration
- SSRF: reach metadata services, internal admin panels, service ports
- DoS: entity expansion (billion laughs), external resource amplification

**Injection Surfaces**
- REST/SOAP/SAML/XML-RPC, file uploads (SVG, Office)
- PDF generators, build/report pipelines, config importers

**Transclusion**
- XInclude and XSLT `document()` loading external resources

## Shapes this takes in code

### Parameter Entities

- Use parameter entities in the DTD subset to define secondary entities that exfiltrate content
- Works even when general entities are sanitized in the XML tree

### XInclude

```xml
<root xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/>
</root>
```

Effective where entity resolution is blocked but XInclude remains enabled in the pipeline.

### XSLT Document

XSLT processors can fetch external resources via `document()`:

```xml
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  <xsl:template match="/">
    <xsl:copy-of select="document('file:///etc/passwd')"/>
  </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```

Targets: transform endpoints, reporting engines (XSLT/Jasper/FOP), xml-stylesheet PI consumers.

### Protocol Wrappers

- Java: `jar:`, `netdoc:`
- PHP: `php://filter`, `expect://` (when module enabled)
- Gopher: craft raw requests to Redis/FCGI when client allows non-HTTP schemes

## Where to look first

**File Uploads**
- SVG/MathML, Office (docx/xlsx/ods/odt), XML-based archives
- Android/iOS plist, project config imports

**Protocols**
- SOAP/XML-RPC/WebDAV/SAML (ACS endpoints)
- RSS/Atom feeds, server-side renderers and converters

**Hidden Paths**
- Parameters: "xml", "upload", "import", "transform", "xslt", "xsl", "xinclude"
- Processing-instruction headers

## Special Contexts

### SOAP

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <!DOCTYPE d [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">]>
    <d>&xxe;</d>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### SAML

- Assertions are XML-signed, but upstream XML parsers prior to signature verification may still process entities/XInclude
- Test ACS endpoints with minimal probes

### SVG and Renderers

- Inline SVG and server-side SVG→PNG/PDF renderers process XML
- Attempt local file reads via entities/XInclude

### Office Docs

- OOXML (docx/xlsx/pptx) are ZIPs containing XML
- Insert payloads into document.xml, rels, or drawing XML and repackage

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's recon agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
