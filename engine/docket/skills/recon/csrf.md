# csrf — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Session Types**
- Web apps with cookie-based sessions and HTTP auth
- JSON/REST, GraphQL (GET/persisted queries), file upload endpoints

**Authentication Flows**
- Login/logout, password/email change, MFA toggles

**OAuth/OIDC**
- Authorize, token, logout, disconnect/connect endpoints

## Shapes this takes in code

### Navigation CSRF

- Auto-submitting form to target origin; works when cookies are sent and no token/origin checks are enforced
- Top-level GET navigation can trigger state if server misuses GET or links actions to GET callbacks

### Simple Content-Type CSRF

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` POSTs do not require preflight
- `text/plain` form bodies can slip through validators and be parsed server-side

### JSON CSRF

- If server parses JSON from `text/plain` or form-encoded bodies, craft parameters to reconstruct JSON
- Some frameworks accept JSON keys via form fields (e.g., `data[foo]=bar`) or treat duplicate keys leniently

### Login/Logout CSRF

- Force logout to clear CSRF tokens, then chain login CSRF to bind victim to attacker's account
- Login CSRF: submit attacker credentials to victim's browser; later actions occur under attacker's account

### OAuth/OIDC Flows

- Abuse authorize/logout endpoints reachable via GET or form POST without origin checks
- Exploit relaxed SameSite on top-level navigations
- Open redirects or loose redirect_uri validation can chain with CSRF to force unintended authorizations

### File and Action Endpoints

- File upload/delete often lack token checks; forge multipart requests to modify storage
- Admin actions exposed as simple POST links are frequently CSRFable

### GraphQL CSRF

- If queries/mutations are allowed via GET or persisted queries, exploit top-level navigation with encoded payloads
- Batched operations may hide mutations within a nominally safe request

### WebSocket CSRF

- Browsers send cookies on WebSocket handshake
- Enforce Origin checks server-side; without them, cross-site pages can open authenticated sockets and issue actions

## Where to look first

- Credentials and profile changes (email/password/phone)
- Payment and money movement, subscription/plan changes
- API key/secret generation, PAT rotation, SSH keys
- 2FA/TOTP enable/disable; backup codes; device trust
- OAuth connect/disconnect; logout; account deletion
- Admin/staff actions and impersonation flows
- File uploads/deletes; access control changes

## Special Contexts

### Mobile/SPA

- Deep links and embedded WebViews may auto-send cookies; trigger actions via crafted intents/links
- SPAs that rely solely on bearer tokens are less CSRF-prone, but hybrid apps mixing cookies and APIs can still be vulnerable

### Integrations

- Webhooks and back-office tools sometimes expose state-changing GETs intended for staff
- Confirm CSRF defenses there too

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's recon agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
