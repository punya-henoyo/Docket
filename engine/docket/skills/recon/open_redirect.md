# open redirect — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Server-Driven Redirects**
- HTTP 3xx Location

**Client-Driven Redirects**
- `window.location`, meta refresh, SPA routers

**OAuth/OIDC/SAML Flows**
- `redirect_uri`, `post_logout_redirect_uri`, `RelayState`, `returnTo`/`continue`/`next`

**Multi-Hop Chains**
- Only first hop validated

## Shapes this takes in code

### Allowlist Evasion

**Common Mistakes**
- Substring/regex contains checks: allows `trusted.com.evil.com`
- Wildcards: `*.trusted.com` also matches `attacker.trusted.com.evil.net`
- Missing scheme pinning: `data:`, `javascript:`, `file:`, `gopher:` accepted
- Case/IDN drift between validator and browser

**Robust Validation**
- Canonicalize with a single modern URL parser (WHATWG URL)
- Compare exact scheme, hostname (post-IDNA), and an explicit allowlist with optional exact path prefixes
- Require absolute HTTPS; reject protocol-relative `//` and unknown schemes

### OAuth/OIDC/SAML

**Redirect URI Abuse**
- Using an open redirect on a trusted domain for redirect_uri enables code interception
- Weak prefix/suffix checks: `https://trusted.com` → `https://trusted.com.evil.com`
- Path traversal/canonicalization: `/oauth/../../@evil.com`
- `post_logout_redirect_uri` often less strictly validated

### Client-Side Vectors

**JavaScript Redirects**
- `location.href`/`assign`/`replace` using user input
- Meta refresh `content=0;url=USER_INPUT`
- SPA routers: `router.push(searchParams.get('next'))`

### Reverse Proxies and Gateways

- Host/X-Forwarded-* may change absolute URL construction
- CDNs that follow redirects for link checking can leak tokens when chained

### SSRF Chaining

- Server-side fetchers (web previewers, link unfurlers) follow 3xx
- Combine with an open redirect on an allowlisted domain to pivot to internal targets (169.254.169.254, localhost)

## Where to look first

- Login/logout, password reset, SSO/OAuth flows
- Payment gateways, email links, invite/verification
- Unsubscribe, language/locale switches
- `/out` or `/r` redirectors

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's recon agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
